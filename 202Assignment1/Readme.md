## CMPE 202 - Assignment 1

This is part of assignment 1 for the course CMPE 202. The given starter code has been modified such that configurations for three types of gumball machines is added with code maintainability and reusability as top priority.

Multiple functions have been created with single task per function in mind such that modularity is accomplished. For each of the task in a Gumball Machine, there is a function defined which is invoked whenever necessary. Certain variables are created with global scope such that they can be accessed anywhere irrespective of type of Gumball Machine. Supposedly, any other configuration is to be added, we will only have to create logic for the new configuration whereas rest of the tasks can be reused from previous configurations.

For convenience purposes, output screenshots have been added depicting the various scenarios in the gumball machine.

In order to run the code, please find gumballmachine.java inside the src folder and run it in any Java compiler. The main method is defined to provide interactive mode for the user to select and operate gumball machines to test the configurations.

In case, there are any issues in running the file or accessing it, kindly bring to my notice.
